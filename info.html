                I'm currently doing my undergrad in <a class="link-text" href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a> and I have a 3 semesters left to graduate. I only learned programming after joining BRAC's CS program so the only language I kind of know is Java. I had a passing familiarity with html due to some work I did for a gaming/social website I was very active in but I hope to become properly familiar with web development languages by the end of <a class="link-text" href="https://piazza.com/brac_university/fall2019/cse391">this course</a>.

                Like most people, I do have hobbies. I'll list a few them below mostly to show that I can use lists:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-type">
                <li class="list-text">Playing video games - Current favourites being Minecraft and Fortnite</li>
                <li class="list-text">Watching show and movies - both live action and animated</li>
                <li class="list-text">Reading - i like reading both regular books and comic books</li>
                <li class="list-text">Illustration - though I haven't dabbled in a while, I really enjoyed making digital art</li>
            </ul>
