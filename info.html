                I'm currently doing my undergrad in <a class="link-text" href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a> and I have a 3 semesters left to graduate. I only learned programming after joining BRAC's CS program so the only language I kind of know is Java. I had a passing familiarity with html due to some work I did for a gaming/social website I was very active in but I hope to become properly familiar with web development languages by the end of <a class="link-text" href="https://piazza.com/brac_university/fall2019/cse391">this course</a>.

            <p class="content-text">
                Like most people, I do have hobbies. I'll list a few them below mostly to show that I can use lists:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-type">
                <li class="list-text">Playing video games - Current favourites being <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" class="link-text">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/play-now/battle-royale" class="link-text">Fortnite</a></li>
                <li class="list-text">Watching show and movies - both live action and animated</li>
                <li class="list-text">Reading - i like reading both regular books and comic books</li>
                <li class="list-text">Illustration - though I haven't dabbled in a while, I really enjoyed making digital art</li>

                <p class="content-text">
                    To showcase tables, I'll list some of my favourite movies - the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. The tables will have the name, an alfred quote and a short note on why I like the movie.
                </p>
                <table class="table-frame">
                    <tr>

                    <tr>

                        <td class="table-content">
                            A great introduction to Batman. Very strong beginning and middle, the last part is meh. Least favourite of the bunch.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                        </td>
                        <td class="table-content">
                            A great movie all around. Lots of memorable moments and quotable lines. Fantastic performance by Heath Ledger as the joker, elevating it even further.

                    </tr>

                            <i>I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you, except pain and tragedy.</i>
                        </td>
                        <td class="table-content">
                            A very satisfying end to the trilogy. It lived up to the hype generated by the trailers and is the one I remember most fondly.
